HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
        <tagName>content</tagName>
        1-its adviced to make the tags with small font
        2-Pay attention to the closing order of tags.
        3-the main tag should contain all the other tags <html>
        4-and before it we put tag for what verion we are using DOCTYPE <!DOCTYPE html>
 
<head>  
        The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag
        HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
        Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
<title>
        The title element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser
            title bar or in the page's tab
            The title element is required in HTML documents!
            The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title
            is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

            The title element:
                defines a title in the browser toolbar
                provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
                displays a title for the page in search engine-results
<body>
        The body tag defines the document's body
        The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document
<p>     tag defines a paragraph
<b>     this is bold text</b>
<u>     this is underLined text</u>
<i>     this is italic text</i>
<s>     this is strike text</s>
<sub>   this is subscript text</sub>
<sup>   this is superscript text</sup>
<small> this is small text</small>
<big>   this is big text</big>
<h1>    this is heading start form <h1>big untill <h6>small
Single elements
        its an element one tag not end like <hr> 
<br>    (Single elements) go to the next line 
<hr>    (Single elements) make a horizontal line
<span> 
        The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
        The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute
        The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element
<div>
        The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
        The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
        The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
        Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 
        Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.
<blockquote>    for quote
<q>     for ""
<kbd>   for keyboard 
<strong>for importen text
<mark>  for high light
<abbr title="like this">        for shory cut
<em>    focus text
images
<images>    <img src="" alt=""> 
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
        The <img> tag has two required attributes:
        src - Specifies the path to the image
        alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
        Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
<ol>    
        for order list can also do <ol start="2"> to start from the secend line
        and for every item we use <li> and the item end with </li> <li>to start the secend item.etc</li>
<ul>    unorder list can  use type for type <ul type = "none">
<dl>    The <dl> tag defines a description list.
        The <dl> tag is used in conjunction with <dt> (defines terms/names) and <dd> (describes each term/name).
        <dl>
        <dt>spiders</dt>
        <dd>scary poion</dd>
        <dt>orange</dt>
        <dd>frute </dd></dl>
<table> The <table> tag defines an HTML table.
        An HTML table consists of one <table> element and one or more <tr>, <th>, and <td> elements.
        we can use <table border="1"> for border
<tr>    element defines a table row
<th>    element defines a table header
<td>    element defines a table cell.
<a>     for link <a href="https://github.com/WissamMU">my github</a>
<i>     for icons <i class="fa fa-car"></i>

<form>  
        The <form> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
        The <form> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:
        https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_form.asp
<input>
        The <input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
        The <input> element is the most important form element.
        The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.
        <input type="button">
<button>
        The <button> tag defines a clickable button.
        Inside a <button> element you can put text (and tags like <i>, <b>, <strong>, <br>, <img>, etc.).
        That is not possible with a button created with the <input> element!
        Tip: Always specify the type attribute for a <button> element, to tell browsers what type of button it is.
        <button>hello</button>
<label> The <label> tag defines a label for several elements:
        <input type="color"> ,<input type="email"> , <input type="number"> ,<input type="password"> (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp)
<audio> The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.
        The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.
        The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
        There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV, and OGG.
        <audio controls>
        <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
        </audio>
<vidio> The <video> tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams.
        The <video> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.

        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
<header>
        The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
        A <header> element typically contains:
        one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
        logo or icon
        authorship information
        Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be
        placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element
<nav>   The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.
        Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.
        Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.
<article>
        The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
        An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site.
        Potential sources for the <article> element:
        Forum post, Blog post, News story
        Note: The <article> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <article> element.
<section>
        The <section> tag defines a section in a document.
<asid>  The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
        The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
        Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
        Note: The <aside> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <aside> element (see example below).
<footer>
        The <footer> tag defines a footer for a document or section.
        A <footer> element typically contains:
        authorship information, copyright information, contact information, sitemap, back to top links, related documents
        You can have several <footer> elements in one document.
<link>  The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
        The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.
        The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="fileName.css">
