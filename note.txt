<head>  
        The head element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the html tag and the body tag
        HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
        Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
<title>
        The title element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser
            title bar or in the page's tab
            The title element is required in HTML documents!
            The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title
            is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

            The title element:
                defines a title in the browser toolbar
                provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
                displays a title for the page in search engine-results
<body>
        The body tag defines the document's body
        The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings,
        paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document
<p>     tag defines a paragraph

<span> 
        The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document
        The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute
        The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element
<div>
        The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
        The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
        The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
        Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 
        Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.

images
<images>    <img src="" alt=""> 
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
        Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
        The <img> tag has two required attributes:
        src - Specifies the path to the image
        alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
        Note: Also, always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.
<ol>    
        for order list can also do <ol start="2"> to start from the secend line
        and for every item we use <li> and the item end with </li> <li>to start the secend item.etc</li>
<ul>    unorder list can  use type for type <ul type = "none">
<dl>    The <dl> tag defines a description list.
        The <dl> tag is used in conjunction with <dt> (defines terms/names) and <dd> (describes each term/name).
